In this project, We have build a American sign language translation project on a word level, which converts the sign to the word.
1. We have manually collected the data through the webcam after veryfying the signs from the American Sign Langague website.
2. Then we have preprocessed the images such as labelling the image with their corresoinding sign and then performing some preprocessing steps such as Converting the RGB image to the Grey Scale and so on.
