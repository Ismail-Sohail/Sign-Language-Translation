In this project, We have build a American sign language translation project on a word level, which converts the sign to the word.
1. We have manually collected the data through the webcam after veryfying the signs from the American Sign Langague website.
2. Then we have preprocessed the images such as labelling the image with their corresoinding sign and then performing some preprocessing steps such as Converting the RGB image to the Grey Scale and so on. Also resized the image and the transformed the image before passing to the CNN Model
3. We had a less amount of images, so we have used the data augumentation technique before passing to the model.
4. The CNN model architecture was developed and trained on the training data.
5. We have the acquired the training and test accuracy of 90 and 92 % respectively.
